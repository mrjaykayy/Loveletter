She wanted to see me. Just once. Just to know if the face her heart whispered about was real.

And when I saw her... something shifted. My heart—it skipped, no, it raced. Not from fear, not from nerves, but from knowing. As if it recognized its home before my mind could understand.

That moment—quiet, innocent, seemingly trivial—was the beginning. The very spark.

From that day on, my heart stopped belonging to me. It beat only for her. And even though I didn’t say it then, I knew: she was mine, and I was hers.`

When you're mad, you turn silent, eyes colder than winter moonlight. But even then, you’re the most beautiful thing I’ve seen.

In those moments, I don’t want to win. I just want to hold you. But I wait. I let the fire pass. I watch your storm, hoping my silence tells you: I'm still here. I never left.

Sometimes love isn’t loud. Sometimes it’s the act of staying beside a closed door, hoping it opens again.

And when it does, when your hand finds mine again—it’s peace. A truce signed in kisses and quiet forgiveness.(If you want you can punish me, Spank me mommmyyyyyyy)`

Your kindness, your strength, your ability to make everything feel just right—I’m in awe of all that you are. Thank you for being my anchor when I was lost, my comfort when I needed it most, and my constant source of happiness. Every day I wake up and feel so incredibly blessed to have you by my side. Every word, every touch, every smile from you feels like a gift I never deserve but always receive.

Whether it’s in your career, your personal growth, or the way you love me—everything you do fills me with admiration. You don’t just face challenges head-on; you embrace them with a smile that makes the whole world seem a little less daunting. I watch you work tirelessly to create a future for us, and it leaves me in awe. Your dreams are big, but you make them seem attainable. And the way you handle the ups and downs, always finding beauty in the journey, inspires me more than words can capture. I’m proud of the woman you are, and I am proud to stand beside you. Every moment spent with you is a treasure, and I can’t wait to see the wonderful things you’ll continue to achieve. I love you, more than you could ever imagine.(And you give such a good head)`

I know that I’m not perfect, and sometimes, I fail to show you how much you mean to me. For every word that hurt, for every action that caused you pain, I am deeply sorry. I’ve realized how often I’ve been lost in my own world, not paying attention to the little things that matter to you. But every day, I’m trying to be better. I don’t want to hurt you again. The love we share is far too precious for me to let anything come between us. Please know that I regret every mistake I’ve made, and I promise to make it up to you. I’m here, always, and I’ll continue to be by your side, making sure you never feel like I’m not listening or not there for you.(I am sorry too, that I am not behind your legs eating that pu- ahamm I mean eating those lips, gotta be respectful no swearing`

Let’s dive into something spontaneous—something that’s as hot and bold as our love. I want to take you on an adventure, somewhere we can truly enjoy each other’s company. Picture us exploring new places, tasting new food, sharing laughter and moments of pure joy. No plans, no expectations—just us, embracing the moment.

Every moment spent with you feels like a gift I never deserve. When I think of you, I can’t help but fall deeper into admiration for everything that you are. You are a masterpiece—crafted by the hands of the universe itself, and I am in awe of every detail, every little thing that makes you, *you*.

I could spend an eternity lost in the beauty of your eyes. They are like stars that light up even the darkest corners of my heart. The way they sparkle when you smile, the way they hold a universe of emotions—*I love them*. Every glance from you feels like a silent promise of love, and I am endlessly grateful for the way you look at me.

And then there’s your lips... Soft as rose petals, tender, and full of warmth. I could lose myself in them, kiss them over and over again, feeling like the luckiest person alive. There’s a sweetness in the way you speak, a softness in your voice that makes everything feel right. 

Your nose, the perfect bridge that complements your face with such grace, seems to reflect the purity of your soul. The little things about you—your laugh, your gestures—make my heart race in a way I never thought was possible.

But, my love, what truly captivates me is not just the surface beauty that the world sees, but the essence of who you are. Your heart, your kindness, your strength, the way you love so deeply—it makes me fall for you over and over again. I love how you always take care of me, how you give yourself so selflessly, how you make our life together feel like a fairytale.

And yes, even the way you *move*, the little things that make you, *you*—I love it all. The way your presence fills a room, the way you make everything feel brighter and more alive. Every part of you is perfect, and I am in awe of it all.

I love everything about you. Every inch of you is perfect to me. Your beauty is something that will never fade, because it lies not just in your appearance, but in the way you make my soul feel. I want to kiss you, hold you, and cherish every moment we share.

You are my everything, and I will love you endlessly.

Forever yours,  
Innocent baby`
